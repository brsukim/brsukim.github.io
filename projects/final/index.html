                            Residential and commercial development in two of Maryland’s “best counties to live in” has
                            resulted in concerns about stream quality within the pivotal Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The
                            county councils
                            of both counties have found their own approaches, or lack thereof, of mitigating
                            environmental collapse.

                            in 2024. At 2,250 permits, numbers like these have not been seen since before the great
                            recession. Similarly,
                            Montgomery County has seen similar growth in its suburbs alongside the I-270 corridor.

                            The increasing expansion of development outside of cities, known as suburban sprawl, results
                            in surface runoff of pollutants into local waterways. Both counties are a part of the
                            greater Potomac River watershed, with all water eventually flowing into the Chesapeake Bay.
                            As a result, pollutants there have lasting impacts across the entire state.

                            According to Maryland GIS data from 2024, nearly all streams in both counties reached a
                            threshold of sediment that surpassed the total maximum daily load, a measurement used to
                            determine the maximum amount of a specific pollutant a waterway can have. Some streams in
                            Frederick County, particularly in the Brunswick Area, needed immediate attention.

                            Additionally, high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen have been reported in all of
                            Frederick and rural portions of Montgomery. Overabundance of these nutrients is known to
                            cause eutrophication, which ultimately results in excessive algae and plant growth and
                            limits sunlight for native marine life.

                            Increased residential development has also produced an increased need for winter-ready
                            roads, leading all Montgomery streams to have a concerning level of chlorides attributed to
                            road salt.

                            In 2020, two bills meant to protect forests and their streams by expanding protection zones
                            expired and were not passed by the Frederick County Council. Bill 20-14, which marginally
                            increased building buffer zones for waterbodies by 25 feet.

                            Since then, environmental regulation by the council has not been directly relevant to
                            environmental concerns on development.

                            Montgomery County, which has seen residential development of high-footprint single-family
                            dwellings drop dramatically in favor for apartments and townhouses, has made steps to combat
                            the already evident effects of sprawl on its streams.

                            In April 2023, the Montgomery County Council passed legislation to protect forests from
                            development in low-density areas. Furthermore, all legislation passed by the council as of
                            2023 is to undergo “Climate Assessment of Zoning,” which aims to ensure any climate effects
                            are accounted for before passing any legislation for the county.

                            According to data provided by the Montgomery County Open Data initiative, residential
                            building permits have stayed consistent for the last four years after a continuous rise
                            since the 2009 recession. In 2024, 7,053 permits were issued, down 38% since 2004, at 9,775
                            permits.

                            Frederick has much to learn from the work that Montgomery has done over the last few years.
                            Groups within Frederick County have supported the Livable Frederick Master Plan, which aims
                            to develop the county in a “sustainable” manner.

                            "The once-rural county of Frederick is now at an important juncture in how they proceed with
                            environmental legislation," said Envision Frederick, the leader in environmental advocacy
                            for the county.
