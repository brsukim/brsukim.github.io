                <p>
                    Residential and commercial development in two of Maryland’s “best counties to live in” has
                    resulted in concerns about stream quality within the pivotal Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The
                    county councils
                    of both counties have found their own approaches, or lack thereof, of mitigating
                    environmental collapse.

                recession. Similarly,
                Montgomery County has seen similar growth in its suburbs alongside the I-270 corridor.

                The increasing expansion of development outside of cities, known as suburban sprawl, results
                in surface runoff of pollutants into local waterways. Both counties are a part of the
                greater Potomac River watershed, with all water eventually flowing into the Chesapeake Bay.
                As a result, pollutants there have lasting impacts across the entire state.

                According to Maryland GIS data from 2024, nearly all streams in both counties reached a
                threshold of sediment that surpassed the total maximum daily load, a measurement used to
                determine the maximum amount of a specific pollutant a waterway can have. Some streams in
                Frederick County, particularly in the Brunswick Area, needed immediate attention.

                Additionally, high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen have been reported in all of
                Frederick and rural portions of Montgomery. Overabundance of these nutrients is known to
                cause eutrophication, which ultimately results in excessive algae and plant growth and

                    Trails such as these in suburban Maryland are built along streams to act as natural riparian

                    trails are built in order to promote greenspace within suburban communities.

                Montgomery County, which has seen residential development of high-footprint single-family
                dwellings drop dramatically in favor for apartments and townhouses, has made steps to combat

                In April 2023, the Montgomery County Council passed legislation to protect forests from
                development in low-density areas. Furthermore, all legislation passed by the council as of
                2023 is to undergo “Climate Assessment of Zoning,” which aims to ensure any climate effects
                are accounted for before passing any legislation for the county.
