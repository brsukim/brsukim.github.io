            <b>Jeffrey Scott Buckley</b> (raised as Scott Moorhead; November 17,
            1966 – May 29, 1997) was an American musician. After a decade as a
            session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a moderate
            following in the early 1990s performing at venues in East Village,
            Manhattan such as Sin-é.

            After rebuffing interest from record labels and Herb Cohen—the
            manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley—he signed with Columbia,
            recruited a band, and released his only studio album, Grace, in
            1994./p>

          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            Born in Anaheim, California, Buckley was the only son of Mary (née
            Guibert) and the singer-songwriter Tim Buckley.

          <p></p>
          <p>
            His mother was a Zonian of Greek, English, French and Panamanian
            descent,[6] while his father was the son of an Irish American father
            and an Italian American mother.[7] Buckley was raised by his mother
            and stepfather, Ron Moorhead, in Southern California, and had a
            half-brother, Corey Moorhead.[8][9] Buckley moved many times in and
            around Orange County while growing up, an upbringing he called
            "rootless trailer trash".[10] As a child, Buckley was known as Scott
            "Scottie" Moorhead, based on his middle name and his stepfather's
            surname.

          <p>
            After graduating from high school, Buckley moved to Hollywood to
            attend the Musicians Institute,[27] completing a one-year course at
            age 19.[28] Buckley later said the school was "the biggest waste of
            time",[17] but said in another interview that he had appreciated
            studying music theory: "I was attracted to really interesting
            harmonies, stuff that I would hear in Ravel, Ellington, Bartók."[29]
          </p>
          <p>
            Buckley's biological father, Tim Buckley, released a series of folk
            and jazz albums in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Jeff said they
            met only once, when he was eight.[11] After Tim died of a drug
            overdose in 1975,[12] Jeff chose to go by Buckley and his given name
            "Jeff", which he found on his birth certificate.[13] To members of
            his family he remained "Scottie".[14]

          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>
            In Los Angeles, Buckley spent six years working in a hotel and
            playing guitar in various bands, playing in styles from jazz,
            reggae, and roots rock to heavy metal.[30] He toured with the
            dancehall reggae artist Shinehead[31] and played occasional funk and
            R&B studio sessions, collaborating with the fledgling producer
            Michael J. Clouse to form X-Factor Productions.[32] From 1988 to
            1989, Buckley played in a band, the Wild Blue Yonder, that included
            John Humphrey and future Tool member Danny Carey.[33] Buckley
            limited his singing to backing vocals.[34]
          </p>
          <p>
            Buckley moved to New York City in February 1990[35] but found few
            opportunities to work as a musician. He was introduced to Qawwali,
            the Sufi devotional music of Pakistan, and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan,
            one of its best-known singers.[36] Buckley was an impassioned fan of
            Khan,[37] and during what he called his "café days", he often
            covered Khan's songs. In January 1996, he interviewed Khan for
            Interview and wrote liner notes for Khan's Supreme Collection, Vol.
            1 compilation. He also became interested in the blues musician
            Robert Johnson and the hardcore punk band Bad Brains during this
            time.[16]
          </p>
          <h3><i>Grace</i></h3>

          <img

            alt="Buckley performing Grace in 1994"
          />
          <p>
            In mid-1993, Buckley began working on his first album with record
            producer Andy Wallace. Buckley assembled a band, composed of bassist
            Mick Grøndahl and drummer Matt Johnson, and spent several weeks
            rehearsing.[62][63]
          </p>
          <p>
            In September, the trio headed to Bearsville Studios in Woodstock,
            New York, to spend six weeks recording basic tracks for what would
            become Grace. Buckley invited ex-bandmate Lucas to play guitar on
            the songs "Grace" and "Mojo Pin", and Woodstock-based jazz musician
            Karl Berger wrote and conducted string arrangements with Buckley
            assisting at times.[64] Buckley returned home for overdubbing at
            studios in Manhattan and New Jersey, where he performed take after
            take to capture the perfect vocals and experimented with ideas for
            additional instruments and added textures to the songs.[65]
          </p>
          <p>
            Sales of Grace were slow, and it garnered little radio airplay
            despite critical acclaim.[77] The Sydney Morning Herald proclaimed
            it "a romantic masterpiece" and a "pivotal, defining work".[78]
            Despite slow initial sales, the album went gold in France and
            Australia over the next two years,[69] achieved gold status in the
            U.S. in 2002,[79] and sold over six times platinum in Australia in
            2006.[80]
          </p>
          <p>
            Grace won appreciation from a number of revered musicians and
            artists, including members of Buckley's biggest influence, Led
            Zeppelin.[81] Jimmy Page considered Grace close to being his
            "favorite album of the decade".[82] Robert Plant was also
            complimentary,[83] as was Brad Pitt, saying of Buckley's work,
            "There's an undercurrent to his music, there's something you can't
            pinpoint. Like the best of films, or the best of art, there's
            something going on underneath, and there's a truth there. And I find
            his stuff absolutely haunting. It just ... it's under my skin."[84]
            Others who had influenced Buckley's music lauded him:[85] Bob Dylan
            named Buckley "one of the great songwriters of this decade",[83]
            and, in an interview with The Village Voice, David Bowie named Grace
            one of 10 albums he would bring with him to a desert island.[86] In
            2010, the Smiths singer Morrissey, one of Buckley's influences,
            named Grace one of his favorite albums.[87]
          </p>
          <h3>Concert tours</h3>
          <p>
            Buckley spent much of the next year and a half touring
            internationally to promote Grace. Following Buckley's Peyote Radio
            Theater tour, the band began a European tour on August 23, 1994,
            starting with performances in the UK and Ireland. The tour continued
            in Scandinavia and, throughout September, numerous concerts in
            Germany were played. The tour ended on September 22 with a concert
            in Paris. A gig on September 24 in New York dovetailed with the end
            of the European tour and Buckley and band spent the next month
            relaxing and rehearsing.[88][failed verification]
            <img src="images/touring.png" alt="Buckley on tour" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Following Johnson's departure, the band, now without a drummer, was
            put on hold and did not perform live again until February 12,
            1997.[95] Due to the pressure from extensive touring, Buckley spent
            the majority of the year away from the stage. However, from May 2 to
            5, he played a short stint as bass guitarist with Mind Science of
            the Mind, with friend Nathan Larson, then guitarist of Shudder to
            Think.[69] Buckley returned to playing live concerts when he went on
            his "phantom solo tour" of cafés in the northeast U.S. in December
            1996, appearing under a series of aliases: the Crackrobats,
            Possessed by Elves, Father Demo, Smackrobiotic, the Halfspeeds,
            Crit-Club, Topless America, Martha & the Nicotines, and A Puppet
            Show Named Julio.[88] By way of justification, Buckley posted a note
            stating he missed the anonymity of playing in cafés and local bars:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            There was a time in my life not too long ago when I could show up in
            a café and simply do what I do, make music, learn from performing my
            music, explore what it means to me, i.e., have fun while I irritate
            and/or entertain an audience who don't know me or what I am about.
            In this situation I have that precious and irreplaceable luxury of
            failure, of risk, of surrender. I worked very hard to get this kind
            of thing together, this work forum. I loved it and then I missed it
            when it disappeared. All I am doing is reclaiming it.[96]
